\title{An S4 class for a nonstationary multivariate class model.}
\description{
A specification class to create an object of a nonstationary multivariate class model reserved for real (empirical) applications. It inherits from \code{simMGarch}.

\describe{
\item{\code{out_of_sample_prop}}{Proportion of y to keep for out-of-sample forecasting expressed in \%.}

\item{\code{out_of_sample_y}}{The out of sample y matrix reserved for forecasting and backtesting exercises.}

\item{\code{in_sample_y}}{The in-sample y matrix reserved for estimation (calibration) and change-point detection.}
